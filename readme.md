I had an issue of not having enough diskspace on my computer. 
I uninstalled a lot of applications, but that didn't seem tp help. 
So I came up with an idea of searching and sorting files in a seperate documents based off file size.
Since I didn't have a good way of transfering all of my files to an external hardrive (Because I dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on an external hardrive that I will probably only use once)
And since I only needed a limited amount of space, it seemed to unncessary to clean my entire computer. 

This program makes it easy for me to clean up files manually. 
I get the path of the file into a file called: disk_usage.txt
And all I have to do is copy paste it into the terminal once I've started search_sort_delete.py searched all of the files and sorted all of the files in the txt file.

Since it's a command line tool, it's not user friendly. Inshallah in the future I will make it more user friendly and create a downloadable setup file.
